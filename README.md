# Responsible AI Toolkit

This project provides a comprehensive toolkit designed to foster ethical and responsible development and deployment of AI systems. It integrates modules for detecting and mitigating common AI-related issues such as bias, lack of explainability, privacy concerns, and model hallucinations, all within an auditable framework. The aim is to enhance transparency, fairness, and trustworthiness in AI applications.

## Features

*   **Bias Detection & Analysis:** Identify and quantify biases within datasets and model predictions to promote fairer outcomes.
*   **Model Explainability:** Gain insights into how AI models make decisions, enhancing transparency and understanding.
*   **Privacy Analysis:** Evaluate and ensure the privacy-preserving aspects of data handling and model usage.
*   **Hallucination Detection:** Detect instances where AI models generate plausible but incorrect or fabricated information, particularly relevant for generative AI.
*   **Comprehensive Audit Trail:** Maintain a detailed log of all analyses and actions, ensuring accountability and traceability.
*   **Interactive User Interface:** A user-friendly web interface (`ui/main_app.py`) for easy interaction with the toolkit's functionalities and visualization of results.
*   **Automated Reporting:** Generate insightful reports (e.g., bias summaries, privacy reports, hallucination detection reports) to document findings and progress.

## Project Structure

*   [`src/`](src/): Contains the core Python modules for bias detection, explainability, privacy analysis, hallucination detection, audit trail, and the main pipeline.
*   [`notebooks/`](notebooks/): Jupyter notebooks for data generation, testing, and demonstrating various components of the toolkit.
*   [`data/`](data/): Example datasets and output data, such as `loan_dataset_with_gender_bias.csv` and `hallucination_detection_results.csv`.
*   [`reports/`](reports/): Stores generated analysis reports in markdown and JSON formats.
*   [`ui/`](ui/): Frontend application files, including `main_app.py` for the UI and `styles.py` for styling.

## Installation

To get this toolkit up and running, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-repo/ethics-toolkit.git
    cd ethics-toolkit
    ```
    (Replace `https://github.com/your-repo/ethics-toolkit.git` with the actual repository URL)

2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

### Running the Streamlit Application

The primary way to interact with the toolkit is through its Streamlit web interface.

1.  **Ensure your virtual environment is active** (if you created one).
2.  **Navigate to the project root directory.**
3.  **Run the Streamlit application:**
    ```bash
    streamlit run ui/main_app.py
    ```
    This will open the application in your web browser, typically at `http://localhost:8501`.

### Running with Docker

You can also run the application using Docker.

1.  **Build the Docker image:**
    ```bash
    docker build -t ethics-toolkit .
    ```

2.  **Run the Docker container:**
    ```bash
    docker run -p 8501:8501 ethics-toolkit
    ```
    The application will be accessible in your web browser at `http://localhost:8501`.

### Using the Core Modules

You can also integrate the core functionalities directly into your Python projects or experiment with them in Jupyter notebooks. Explore the `src/` directory for individual modules and the `notebooks/` directory for usage examples.
